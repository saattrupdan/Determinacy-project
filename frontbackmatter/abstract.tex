\section*{\huge Abstract}
In this project we introduce the notions of perfect information games in a set-theoretic context, from where we'll analyse both the consequences of the determinacy of games as well as showing large classes of games are determined.

More precisely, we'll show that determinacy of games over the reals implies that every subset of the reals is Lebesgue measurable and has both the Baire and perfect set property (thereby contradicting the axiom of choice). Next, Martin's result on Borel determinacy will be presented, as well as his proof of analytic determinacy from the existence of a Ramsey cardinal.

Lastly, we'll present a certain kind of stochastic games (that is, games involving chance) called \textit{Blackwell games}, and present Martin's proof that determinacy of perfect information games imply the determinacy of Blackwell games.
